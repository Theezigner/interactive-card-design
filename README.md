# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form

This project is a visually interactive credit card form built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Users can enter card details and instantly see the card preview update in real-time. It was developed as the first official assignment for the third semester of my frontend engineering course, with a focus on DOM manipulation, form validation, and responsive layout using modern tools.

---

## Project Overview

The form is split into two main parts:
1. A responsive credit card preview section (front and back) that updates live as users type.
2. A form section that collects cardholder name, number, expiration date, and CVC.

On successful submission, the form transitions to a "Thank You" screen with an option to reset and resubmit.

## Features

- Live preview of:
  - Card number (formatted in real-time)
  - Cardholder name (converted to uppercase)
  - Expiration date (MM/YY)
  - CVC (on the card back)
- Auto-formatting for:
  - Card number input (`1234 5678 9012 3456`)
  - Month capping at `12`
  - CVC limited to 3 digits
- Dynamic error handling using native validation patterns
- Reset-to-form functionality after submission
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Built using vanilla TypeScript (no frameworks)

## What I Learned

This project helped me:
- Master **DOM creation and manipulation** without using JSX or any framework.
- Understand **real-time form updates** by syncing input values with visual elements.
- Use **Tailwind CSS responsively** to control layout across screen sizes.
- Apply **form validation patterns** using HTML5 and TypeScript safely.

Example of card number formatting:
```ts
input.value = input.value
  .replace(/\D/g, '')
  .slice(0, 16)
  .replace(/(.{4})/g, '$1 ')
  .trim();
```

---

## Future Improvements

- Add full validation messages (e.g., "Invalid number format").
- Implement card brand detection (Visa, MasterCard, etc.).
- Improve accessibility (aria-labels, tab flow, etc.).
- Allow Amex-style formatting (`XXXX XXXXXX XXXXX` for 15 digits).
